The OSI model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that 'provides a common basis for the coordination of [ISO] standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection'.[2] In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
Types of Area Networks

Common types of area networks are:

    LAN: Local Area Network
    WAN: Wide Area Network
    WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
    MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
    SAN: Storage Area Network, System Area Network, Server Area Network, or sometimes Small Area Network
    CAN: Campus Area Network, Controller Area Network, or sometimes Cluster Area Network
    PAN: Personal Area Network
MAC Address?

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network. Itâ€™s tied to a key connection device in your computer called the network interface card, or NIC. The NIC is essentially a computer circuit card that makes it possible for your computer to connect to a network. A NIC turns data into an electrical signal that can be transmitted over the network.
