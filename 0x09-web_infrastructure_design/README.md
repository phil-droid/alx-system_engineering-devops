DESCRIPTION
Client
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requester called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources.
Internet
The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it’s possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.

As we know when we type something on our browser we expect an answer, here you are going to find the steps to get this answer. First we need to understand some concepts.

Client
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requester called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc. When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).


After the client write the request in the browser, the request need’s the internet.

Internet
The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it’s possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.

You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called going online. When someone says a computer is online, it’s just another way of saying it’s connected to the Internet.

It’s important to realize that the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.

When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer’s hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer.


The request that we send to the internet need’s to translate the domain name into an Ip address

Dynamic name service (DNS)
The process of DNS resolution involves converting a host name (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
Is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or an extranet).

HTTP and HTTPS
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The ‘S’ at the end of HTTPS stands for ‘Secure’. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

Web server
A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. Besides HTTP, web servers also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used for email, file transfer and storage.

Application Server
An application server is a server specifically designed to run applications. The “server” includes both the hardware and software that provide an environment for programs to run.

Application servers are used for many purposes. Several examples are listed below:

running web applications
hosting a hypervisor that manages virtual machines
distributing and monitoring software updates
processing data sent from another server

Database (DB)
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
